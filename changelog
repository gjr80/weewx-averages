v0.5.0
*   initial implementation (started at v0.5.0 to align with SLE version)
*   now packaged as a weewx extension
*   reworked the SLE class:
    -   took get_first_day() method out of the SLE class
    -   consolidated SLE getMonthAveragesHighsLows() method into 
        get_extension_list() method
    -   reworked algorithm to calculate means, now use BoM definitions. Refer 
        class comments for details.
    -   no longer use partial months at start and end of archive for anything, 
        only use complete archive months. Note, any partial months after the 
        first complete month and before the last complete month are still 
        'included'.
*   added config{} to averages.js allow users to change common look and feel
    settings without delving into the code.
