Version: 1.0.0                                   Date: 25 May 2020

Revision History
    25 May 2020         v1.0.0
        - now WeeWX 3 and WeeWX 4 (python 2 or 3) compatible
        - renamed search list file and search list class
    30 September 2016   v0.5.0
        - now packaged as a weewx extension
        - reworked the SLE class:
            - took get_first_day() method out of the SLE class
            - consolidated SLE getMonthAveragesHighsLows() method into
              get_extension_list() method
            - reworked algorithm to calculate means, now use BoM definitions. 
              Refer class comments for details.
            - no longer use partial months at start and end of archive for
              anything, only use complete archive months. Note, any partial 
              months after the first complete month and before the last complete
              month are still 'included'.
    10 May 2016         v0.4.0
       - no change, version number upgrade only
    April 2016          v0.3.0
       - no change, version number upgrade only
    5 March 2016        v0.2.2
       - fixed bug in that entire months with no records caused MonthAverages to
         fail
    21 July 2015        v0.2.1
       - reworked comments
       - remove old redundant code
    19 March 2015       v0.2.0
       - no change, version number upgrade only
    22 February 2015    v0.1.0
       - initial implementation

                - average rainfall
                - mean temperature

            The following definitions are used:

            Average rainfall. The average rainfall for each month, calculated
            over all years of record.

            Maximum temperature. The highest temperature, for each month,
            observed at the site over all years of record.

            Mean maximum temperature. The average daily maximum temperature,
            for each month, calculated over all years of record.

            Minimum temperature. The lowest temperature, for each month,
            observed at the site over all years of record.

            Mean minimum temperature. The average daily minimum temperature,
            for each month, calculated over all years of record.

            Mean temperature. The mean of the daily mean temperature, for each
            month, observed at the site over all years of record. The daily
            mean temperature is defined as the sum of the daily maximum
            temperature and the daily minimum temperature divided by two.

            Results are calculated using daily summary data from daily summary
            tables. Aggregates are calculated as follows:
                - average rainfall. Calculate the total rainfall for each Jan,
                  Feb...Dec then calculate a simple average by dividing each
                  month total by the number of years of those months in our
                  data.
                - mean temp. Sum the mean temperature for each Jan, Feb...Dec
                  then calculate s simple average by dividing each month total
                  by the number of years of those months in our data.
                - maximum and minimum temp. Maximum and minimum tempeature
                  obeserved in each Jan, Feb...Dec.
                - mean maximum temp. Sum the mean maximum temp for each Jan,
                  Feb...Dec then calculate s simple average by dividing each
                  month total by the number of years of those months in our
                  data.
                - mean minimum temp. Sum the mean minimum temp for each Jan,
                  Feb...Dec then calculate s simple average by dividing each
                  month total by the number of years of those months in our
                  data.

            Partial months of data at the start and end of the archive are
            ignored. Incomplete or partial months between the first and last
            months of data are included in the calculations.

            Returned values are JSON strings representing results for Jan, Feb
            thru Dec. Months that have no data are returned as Null. Unit
            conversion and rounding is applied to the JSON results as per
            skin.conf/weewx.conf override settings.
